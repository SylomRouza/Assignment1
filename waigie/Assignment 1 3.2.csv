"Northern Lights Abisko National Park
This is a truly beautiful area to visit and see the Northern Lights. Our first disappointment was after booking the accomodation we got an email a few days later saying the activities would not begin operation until a week after we left and that the restaurant would not be operational. This was really annoying as we could easily have booked a week later had we known. Then once we arrived on the train after an 18 hour trip, with just about everyone else who was booking in at the time, we had to wait for around 3 hours to check into our room, as reception wasn't open until 2pm. It meant we had no where to leave our stuff, and couldn't make use of our few hours of daylight to explore the National Park. Anyhow, this is just the logistical stuff and although it is annoying to deal with these obstacles and time wasting issues when travelling, Abisko is an amazing area, and I can highly recommend this amazing area. The best part was that we were lucky enough to see some of the lights from the warmth of our room. I can highly recommend the location and am grateful to have been able to experience this amazing part of the world.","area - truly beautiful

"Trails Are Well Sign Posted
There is not a lot to do in Abisko (especially in the low season). We were there to see the northern lights and would have been very bored if not for this National Park.
There are quite a few trails to choose from depending on your ability/how much time you have. We were there in October before any heavy snow fall.
What I really appreciated was how well the trails are marked. There are frequent indicators along the trails which are very reassuring.
You can get there by walking from the main village (30-40mins) or taking the train (less than 10mins).","trails - well-marked

"Perfect for beginners
Having done a bit of hiking but still considering ourselves beginners we found this area perfect. There are a number of day hikes (of half day) you can do that are not too strenuous. We tried three of them and only the last one was a bit difficult in that the ground was still soggy in many places and the path was at one point not well marked. There are small mosquitos (called knott in Swedish) that you need to prepare for. They are soundless and do not hurt when they sting (they itch afterwards though). We found our South African repellent quite effective but found out that it does not protect you under a sock, they stung through it in considerable numbers.","area - perfect

"Winter view
Staying at the Abisko Mountain Lodge is a perfect stay for activities in the park. The Husky sledge ride was brilliant and Julia navigated expertly along the snowy lanes to a tipee where she made a fire, heated drinks and fed us with cinnamon buns, brilliant. The dogs were great and they obviously loved pulling sledges very bouncy and friendly. This was a great way to see the Park.","stay - perfect

"Hiking
What a peaceful place to be. It?s you and the nature.
All the walking routes are marked and they all have different length.
We took a nice walk next to the river. If you want to you can walk all day.
But this time of year it?s only light roundabout 2 hours a day. Today it was from 11-2 o clock.
It?s crazy, when it?s 3 o clock it?s pretty much pitch dark and it feels like it?s 10 pm.","place - peaceful

"Splendid tundra hikes
I may be biased as my favourite type of holiday is hiking - preferably in colder parts of the world (mountains or tundra usually). Abisko has to offer a beautiful scenery and accessible hiking trails. This is also an endpoint of the Kungsleden trail which is on my bucket list to hike. I was here during the summer but I am determined to go back when autumn colours are most beautiful and also in early spring because this place has so much more to offer. Top location for me, highly recommend to everyone.","tundra hikes - splendid

"Magical Place!
We went to the Abisko National Park to try and see the Northern Lights. We got lucky, and were treated to a stunning show of the Auroras.

It was just magical to be standing on a huge frozen lake, minus 29 degrees, watching the Northern Lights dance across the sky. An experience I will never forget.

My personal highlight was driving by a Moose on the side of the road, who looked like he was staring up at the sky.","place - magical

"The start of the Kungsleden and more
This is a beautiful place with many hiking options. Many hikers know the park as the northern start of the King's Trail, but it is also a place filled with many options for shorter backpacking adventures or day hikes. The beauty of the mountains, rivers, lakes, etc. - plus the availability of huts and campsites - make this a wonderful place to explore.","place - beautiful

"Beautiful Park
We had a GREAT time in Abisko. We saw the Northern Lights all 3 nights. The second night being spectacular after a G1 Solar Storm.

The hotel IN the national park (STF Abisko Mountain Station) was great ? we booked a ROOM and not one of the HOSTEL rooms. The rooms are not fancy but big and a king bed which is nice. I signed up for the Sweden National Park membership and that saved me some $ on both the trains and the National Park Hotel.

One day we hiked down to the frozen lake and it was a great, easy night hike. It was beautiful and relaxing.","park - beautiful

"Amazing northern lights experienc
There is some research that has shown that due to Abisko's location in Europe (the mountains and cloud cover) it is one of the best places to see the northern lights and I couldn't agree more. It is stunning and there is an amazing lake that is breathtaking. I was there in January and it was absolutely freezing (maximum of two hours outside) but wow, it was beautiful. There is also a webcam set up by one of the local companies (Lights over Lapland) that shows that northern lights activies so you can stay inside until you see there 'dancing' and then go outside to see the magic - stunning,","northern lights experience - amazing

"Surreal beyond words
We were there in December of 2017 for the Northern Lights with Lights over Lapland. The 17-hour train journey into the Arctic circle was just a glimpse into what would be our most memorable experience. The sheer vastness, the pure white snow & ice, the silence of nature, the still winter trees - it was nature doing what she does best - make us speechless. Our Northern Lights & Dog-sledding experiences will remain entrenched in our minds & memories forever. We'll back :)","experience - most memorable

"A stunning landscape and great cabins at Bjorkliden Kappas village
A stunning landscape and if the weather is kind in winter a place of great beauty even though relatively isolated. Being inland can get super cold though - should have more clear skies and auroras but we missed out on the mega displays they had the week earlier when Siberian front hit. Acess is flights via Stockholm to Kiruna and either taxi or the airport and cabin minibus shuttle.","landscape - stunning

"Winter wonderland
This is a great place to sled, ski, wonder at the beauty of so many silver birch (very few firs as they struggle to get established in their first year) and, of course, look at the aurora.

The week we were there has just one day when the sky wasn't mostly (or completely) clear. Very little wind. The ""blue hole of Abisko"" was very real - we travelled in either direction east/west on E10 and the weather changed within 40km.","place - great
wind - very little",,,4
"Arctic nature
The park is located in a nice area full of lakes and between mountains. Is a protected site for birds breeding and offers interesting hiking trails that allows the exploration of the valley and the local Flora. Unfortunately the naturium center was closed during the winter so we probably lost some opportunities to learn more about the park. Also probably a map with clearly indicated trails for snowshoeing would help better the tourists to orientate themselves in the park and better understand where they will go following the different paths.","area - nice

"Just amazing
We visited Abisko national park during our overland trip from Dubai to European countries. We could spend only a night there. It's so peaceful and loads of flora and fauna. There is beauty everywhere. Pristine lakes and mountain peaks with snow. The mid night sun makes it all the more beautiful. Wish we could stay longer.",lake - pristine,,,5
"Northern nature at its best
The Park is peaceful, welcoming and wild.
Hiking there is like hiking in wonderland, the plants, trees and wild life.
The STF huts are just in place, not even scratch the harmony.
One of the best backpacking places I've been in, highly recommended.","park - peaceful, welcome and wild

"Lovable
I simply love this place, the vast lake, tall mountains, wild forests and tundra all together. If it is serenity, adventure, challenge or just spectacular view you are after, you will all find it here. And most of it within the reach of 10 minutes walk. It is the most iconic national park in Sweden and there is a reason for it.","lake - vast

"Just stunning scenery
We spent hours walking around the park and found the scenery spectacular. The Gorge was amazing with the frozen waterfall and river creating wonderful ice sculptures. The ""u"" shaped valley dominates the skyline and the snow covered hills and mountains make a superb backdrop. We drove dog sleds through the park and had to be careful not to be distracted by the views.","scenery - stunning

"A really nice walk in the park even in winter!
Came for the Northern Light but this only happens in the dark. What a better way to walk in the national park during the daylight hours. Enjoyed our walk in the marked path but can be difficult to know where you are going in the winter snow since most of the path were buried in snow. The walk to the lake takes about 20 mins (i guess) from the hotel building.","walk - really nice

"Follow the signs.
On our recent trip to Abisko we took a walk in the National Park. My husband had already done this walk two days earlier and got hopelessly lost and had to retrace his steps to get back to base. So we decided to take the same walk to see where he went wrong. It was an orange marked walk which was estimated to take 2 hrs to complete. We started off in heavy snowy conditions and managed to follow the orange markers which were on the trunks of trees along the route every 50 yards or thereabouts. The route was lovely, taking us alongside the frozen river and into birch tree woods. We arrived at a bend in the track where the heavily trampled snow veered off to the left and I followed this instinctively as there were posts along the track with red exes on them, denoting Winter Track. My husband said that this was what he did the time before and he hadn't seen any further orange signs after doing so. So I backtracked and we both searched for an orange sign on a tree. We eventually spotted one a good way off in another direction but it was not easy to find and the track was not well trodden. All was well this time and we finished our walk in the park without further problem. I think the Park Rangers should certainly check the signage especially in winter conditions for the use of non locals. It would not be a nice thing to find yourself wandering in sub zero temperatures when darkness falls here.","walk - orange marked

"We saw the Northern Lights!!
Like everyone who visits Lapland, of course we really wanted to see the Northern Lights during our visit and we're worried we would be unlucky. It had been cloudy and snowing in Kiruna for days, but on our last night we drove up to Abisko National Park with our fingers crossed. It was still cloudy and snowing when we arrived, but it cleared up by nighttime and we were able to see the Northern Lights from behind the STF lodge! We took the trail that goes down to the lake and saw even more from there. Truly amazing!

Aside from that, we weren't able to do much hiking because it was so snowy and icy. However we did the ""canyon"" trail and the trail down to the lake and back during the day, which were both pleasant and very easy for all sorts of hikers. We saw some ice climbers in the canyon, which was cool!",trail - pleasant and very easy,,,5
"Northern Lights & More
I visited Abisko for four nights in the middle of February, and had a wonderful time. What people say about the region's unique micro-climate is absolutely true. Dark, cloudy days magically turn clear at sunset, when the stars suddenly appear. What I did notice is that evening weather conditions are typically the opposite of daytime conditions. Clearer days seem to lead to cloudier nights, and vice-versa. Make sure you check the Sky Station and Lights Over Lapland webcams for current aurora sightings. Step outside shortly after sunset. If you see stars, that's a great sign.

The sky station is a real must. The chairlift itself is like a ride into space. You glide up to a snow-covered mountain surrounded by brilliant stars. Although it's a bit of a climb up a winding staircase, there is a small rooftop at the station that is perfect for aurora photography--skip the unstable conditions on the mountain and use this as a sturdy base for your tripod. The rooftop also has a sturdy guardrail, and a number of people without tripods were able to take great photos using the rail to stabilize their cameras.","time - wonderful

"Pristine and gorgeous
Even without the Aurora Borealis this would be worth the visit. We took a hike on snow shoes with a local guide. They have large hills to climb that give views of the whole valley which has a huge, mountain ringed lake to look down upon.
If you like photography there are so many gorgeous options to shoot. There is a collection of Sami, the indigenous people of the Lapland, dwellings to visit. The natural beauty is astounding. There are moose, elusive wolverines and Arctic hares in the area. Abisko has a uniquely shaped mountain range that looks like to had a huge bite out of it. It is where a glacier receded long ago. Stunning to photograph. Well worth a visit. Feels like you are above the entire world.","hills - large

"Magnificnent park for aurora viewing
Just returned from fabulous trip to Abisko with a group of ten friends. We went with a tour company Lights Over Lapland which was outstanding. The photographer guide an Englishman named Oliver was amazing- helpful knowledgeable and always available patient and friendly The setting is spectacular- we were lucky with clear sunny days, hoarfrost ice crystals on the trees and glorious views over frozen lake We saw the aurora on several nights, most impressively from the ski lift and Sky Station- it was an awesome experience. A 12 km dog sledding excursion was tremendous fun as well Rooms were small but clean and perfectly adequate, meals were excellent and the lodge fosters camaraderie","park - magnificent

"Awesome and humbling
We visited the Abisko National Park in Feb 2017 and even though the weather was unusually mild (mostly only minus 7 degrees) the snowy landscape wilderness was awesome.
We saw Arctic hares and plenty of animal tracks of unknown creatures among the birch forest. Such a beautiful place, no mossies in winter, yay!

"A blissful, cold but cosy adventure
When we arrived at Abisko National Park we were welcomed by glittering vastness of fresh snow and snowfall, which, coupled with the very serene atmosphere, was sheer bliss.

Visiting mid-December we witnessed days of twilight. Nights were (surprisingly) around -7§C lowest, skies mainly cloudy and of the few days we were, Northern Lights presented themselves fairly faintly! Nevertheless, when clearer skies did appear it was a wonderful location to stargaze.

Accommodation (Abisko Guesthouse) was cosy, clean and quiet with very hospitable staff.","fresh snow and snowfall - glittering vastness

"Visiting the Sami traditional camp reconstruction in the National park
The Sami traditional camp is the only structure in the National Park that was not closed when we visited in late October. It is 500m from the Tourist Centre and is a quiet meditative space amongst the Birch trees. There is a reconstruction of each of the type of structures found in a Sami traditional camp with a short description of each structure in Swedish and English. It would be beneficial if an information board could be set up near the entrance to the camp to tell us more about the Sami people. There must be so much interesting information available that could provide more context to the camp.","space - quiet meditative

"Rude staff
I did dog sleigh last january 12' 2018. We were staying at stf abisko and this girl came to pick us up. I forgot her name but she is spanish and a little bit boyish.
First she was late which is ok,then we head to the office to change our clothes. While giving the suits and the shoes shes very lazy to change the size. Especially with the shoes like for me my sboe size varies from 39-40 depending on the type of the shoes. So when i ask her to change mine she said ""you told me earlier this was your size now you want to change"" and then i told her because your shoes have differnt size depending of the brand. From then on she didnt talk to us. And luckily we joined a different team which has a male guide who is very very sweet.
Beware of this tour guide. Shane i forgot her name but shes spanish and very rude.

"Cavalier activities
Whilst visiting the park on 25th March 2015...(signage left a lot to be desired)...observed an organised group of ice climbers in the canyon. Horrified to see that the ropes were attached directly around the trees...no padding or protection at all. Ignorant at best, criminal negligence at worst...even teenagers slack-lining in a park will protect the bark of a tree!
Subsequent emails to Abisko Naturem and Tourist Centre in Kiruna have gone unanswered.
You either care about the fragile arctic ecosystem, or you simply take the easy money...sad!","group of ice climbers - organised
